# FAZBot
Cartesian 3D Printer Heavily inspired by AlephObject's TAZ Bot 6. Instead of using alumunum extrusions, the frame is machined in 25mm MDF.
It also uses Nema 23 stepper motors since 

There are two FreeCAD files. One containing all the necessary bodies/models and one just for the assembly.
Entirely designed in FreeCAD 0.18.
